# Application of UAVs Swarms for Real-Time Monitoring of Wildfires

This project explores the application of UAVs swarms for real-time detection and monitoring of wildfires. The initiative was inspired by the XPRIZE project, which aims to address the tremendous damage caused by large-scale wildfires. This approach focuses on the deployment of drone swarms as an effective strategy for the early detection and ongoing monitoring of wildfires, especially in areas where traditional methods fall short.

## From Satellites to UAVs Swarms Monitoring

Satellite monitoring is effective for large, inaccessible areas, but its limitations include low spatial resolution, infrequent data updates, and susceptibility to cloud cover, making it less reliable for detecting smaller fires in real-time.
While UAVs monitoring offers high-resolution, real-time data by operating at lower altitudes and dynamically adjusting to conditions.

While they excel at detecting smaller fires and are less affected by cloud cover, UAVs face challenges like limited battery life, weather sensitivity, and airspace management. Moreover, sensor fusion techniques, already used in fields like autonomous vehicle navigation and precision agriculture, hold promise for enhancing the accuracy and reliability of wildfire detection systems deployed on UAV platforms.
