# Application of UAVs Swarms for Real-Time Detection and Monitoring of Wildfires

## Description

This project explores the application of UAV (drone) swarms for the real-time detection and monitoring of wildfires. The initiative was inspired by the XPRIZE project, which aims to address the immense damage caused by large-scale wildfires. Our approach focuses on the deployment of drone swarms as an effective strategy for the early detection and ongoing monitoring of wildfires, especially in areas where traditional methods fall short.

## 1. Introduction - Context of Forest Fires and Their Impact

A wildfire is an uncontrolled fire that burns in wildland vegetation, often in rural areas. Wildfires can occur in forests, grasslands, savannas, and other ecosystems, affecting all continents and environments. The smoke from wildfires is a dangerous mixture of pollutants like PM2.5, NO2, ozone, aromatic hydrocarbons, and lead. These pollutants not only contaminate the air but also contribute to climate change by releasing large amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

## 2. State of the Art

### 2.1 Satellite Detection

Satellites are a widely used tool in wildfire detection due to their ability to cover large, inaccessible areas. However, they face significant limitations, including low spatial resolution, which makes detecting smaller fires difficult. Additionally, their temporal resolution, or the frequency with which they can revisit the same area, limits their ability to provide real-time data. Environmental factors like cloud cover further hinder their effectiveness.

### 2.2 UAVs Detection

Drones, unlike satellites, can operate at lower altitudes, capturing high-resolution images that allow for the detection of smaller fires. They can also be deployed on-demand, offering real-time or near-real-time data collection. Drones are not limited by cloud cover and can adjust their flight patterns dynamically, making them highly effective for focused monitoring of high-risk areas. However, challenges like battery life, weather conditions, data transmission, and airspace management still need to be addressed.

### 2.4 AI-Detection Advances

AI algorithms, particularly Deep Learning (DL) techniques, are increasingly being used in wildfire detection due to their ability to automatically extract relevant features from data. While traditional Supervised Learning (SL) methods require expert input to select valuable features, DL techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can handle this automatically. However, these methods require large datasets and significant processing power.

## 3. Description of Technical Characteristics

### 3.1 Methodology

Our methodology is built on three core components:

1. Development of a robust AI algorithm capable of processing multispectral data for early fire detection and progression modeling.
2. Design of an adaptive swarm intelligence framework enabling a fleet of drones to efficiently cover large areas and adjust their flight patterns based on real-time data.
3. Integration of these components into a cohesive system that can operate autonomously or in collaboration with human-led firefighting efforts.

### 3.2 Embedded Sensors

Optical cameras are commonly used in wildfire detection but face limitations, such as an inability to detect smoke at night and challenges in dense forests. Thermal imaging cameras, which detect heat signatures even in darkness, can overcome some of these limitations but also have challenges, such as lower spatial resolution. To address these issues, we propose the use of sensor fusion—combining data from optical, thermal, and other sensors (e.g., infrared, radar, chemical)—to create a more comprehensive and accurate wildfire detection system.

Sensor fusion techniques, already used in fields like autonomous vehicle navigation and precision agriculture, hold promise for enhancing the accuracy and reliability of wildfire detection systems deployed on UAV platforms.
