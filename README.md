# Application of UAVs Swarms for Real-Time Detection and Monitoring of Wildfires

This project explores the application of UAVs swarms for real-time detection and monitoring of wildfires. The initiative was inspired by the XPRIZE project, which aims to address the immense damage caused by large-scale wildfires. Our approach focuses on the deployment of drone swarms as an effective strategy for the early detection and ongoing monitoring of wildfires, especially in areas where traditional methods fall short.

## From Satellites to UAVs Swarms

Satellite Detection is effective for monitoring large, inaccessible areas, but its limitations include low spatial resolution, infrequent data updates, and susceptibility to cloud cover, making it less reliable for detecting smaller fires in real-time.
UAVs Detection offers high-resolution, real-time data by operating at lower altitudes and dynamically adjusting to conditions. While they excel at detecting smaller fires and are unaffected by cloud cover, UAVs face challenges like limited battery life, weather sensitivity, and airspace management. Moreover, sensor fusion techniques, already used in fields like autonomous vehicle navigation and precision agriculture, hold promise for enhancing the accuracy and reliability of wildfire detection systems deployed on UAV platforms.


## Features

- Real-time wildfire detection: Instantly identifies and tracks fires using multispectral data.
- Dynamic UAV coordination: Automatically adjusts drone flight paths for optimal coverage.
- Scalable swarm deployment: Efficiently monitors large areas with coordinated UAVs.
- Autonomous operation: Operates independently or with human teams.
- Interactive visualization: Displays real-time fire data through an intuitive interface.


## Installation
