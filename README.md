# Application of UAVs Swarms for Real-Time Monitoring of Wildfires

This project explores the application of UAVs swarms for real-time detection and monitoring of wildfires. The initiative was inspired by the XPRIZE project, which aims to address the tremendous damage caused by large-scale wildfires. This approach focuses on the deployment of drone swarms as an effective strategy for the early detection and ongoing monitoring of wildfires, especially in areas where traditional methods fall short.

## 🌍 Why This Matters

- 🧯 Wildfires cost **billions annually**, destroy ecosystems, and claim lives.
- 🛰 Satellite systems are **too slow or coarse** for early detection in critical scenarios.
- 🚁 UAVs offer **agile**, **high-resolution**, and **on-demand monitoring** with real-time responsiveness.

This project explores how **UAV swarms**, equipped with multispectral sensors and AI-based coordination, can **outperform traditional methods** in wildfire detection, mitigation, and support for emergency teams.

## 🛰 From Satellites to Smart UAV Swarms

| Monitoring Method | Pros | Cons |
|------------------|------|------|
| 🛰️ Satellite Imaging | Wide coverage, global availability | Low revisit rate, cloud cover issues, coarse resolution |
| 🚁 UAV Swarms | Real-time, high-res, flexible deployment | Battery limits, weather sensitivity, coordination complexity |

By integrating **AI-based coordination** and **sensor fusion**, this system maximizes the spatial and temporal resolution needed for wildfire management - especially in terrain inaccessible to humans or traditional aircraft.
